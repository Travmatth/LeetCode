"""
Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O),
capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in
that surrounded region.
Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means
that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to
'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not
connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected
horizontally or vertically.
